"# PlanetSim" 
A basic simulation of solar system orbits using Newtonian physics, the sum of gravitational forces of each body in the system. The scale of the planetsâ€™ radii is not accurate. It will export the sim's positon's data in a csv and parquet file after closing. Got this idea from Tech With Tim YT.
